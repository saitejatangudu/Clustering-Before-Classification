# Enhancing Classification Performance with Clustering: IPL Data Analysis

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks focusing on enhancing classification performance using IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match data. By leveraging clustering techniques as a preprocessing step, the objective is to improve the accuracy of classification models in predicting match outcomes.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. IPL Data Preparation for Analysis
- **Objective:** Thorough preparation of IPL cricket match data for analysis and classification.
- **Key Data Preparation Steps:**
  - Loading IPL match data from CSV files into DataFrames.
  - Cleaning the data by dropping unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
  - Extracting relevant features such as total runs, balls remaining, and wickets remaining.
  - Filtering out irrelevant matches, including abandoned matches and those with super overs.
  - Preparing the dataset for further analysis by excluding unwanted columns and deriving new features.

### 2. Pre-Clustering as Preprocessing Step
- **Objective:** Demonstrating the effectiveness of clustering as a preprocessing step for classification.
- **Key Processes:**
  - Utilizing KMeans clustering algorithm to organize IPL match data into clusters.
  - Storing the pre-clustered dataset for subsequent analysis and classification tasks.

### 3. KNN Classification over Pre-Clustered Data
- **Objective:** Enhancing classification performance using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm over pre-clustered IPL match data.
- **Key Components:**
  - Building and fine-tuning KNN classifier on pre-clustered features.
  - Evaluating model performance and visualizing results to assess the impact of clustering on classification accuracy.

### 4. Neural Network Classification over Pre-Clustered Data
- **Objective:** Exploring the enhancement of classification performance using pre-clustered IPL cricket match data with neural network models.
- **Key Components:**
  - Defining and training various configurations of neural network models with different activation functions, weight initializers, and optimizers.
  - Computing evaluation metrics such as accuracy score, classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC curve to assess model performance.
  - Visualizing the impact of clustering on classification accuracy through comparison of different model configurations.

## Conclusion
The notebooks in this repository emphasize the importance of thorough data preparation, particularly in the context of IPL cricket match data analysis. By meticulously cleaning and organizing the data and leveraging clustering techniques as a preprocessing step, classification models can better capture underlying patterns and relationships, ultimately leading to more accurate predictions of match outcomes.
